![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=Project+Banner)

> This is a project I worked on while learning about Airflow and task orchestration.
The goal of this project was to learn airflow and build a simple data backup application.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Use Airflow provided PostgresToGCSOperator on a single table or set of tables to back up data to a GCS blob
- 🔥 Created custom Operators and Hooks to learn how to inherit from Airflow provided base classes to learn more on the Airflow-provided functionality.
- ⚡ Running DBT models using Docker In Docker
- 🎯 Running DBT models using Docker Standalone (submit job to provisioned containers)
